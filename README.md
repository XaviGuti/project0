# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript


My first website for project0 has a total of 5 pages.
    1)Homepage
    2)Tables
    3)Lists
    4)Image
    5)Bootstrap


The Homepage welcomes the website visitor. Links are available at the top of the page to navigate to other pages of the website.

The Table page shows the schools I've gone to in the past.

The List page shows a simple unordered grocery list.

The Image page shows a photograph that I took of a sunflower.

The Bootstrap page uses the bootstrap stylesheet link and use it to creat 4 (3 column) cells.

The sytling comes from 2 .css files, one being style.css and the other nav_style.css. nav_style.css is generated from the
nav_style.scss file. The style.css file contains the majority of the styling used on this site while the nav_style.scss file contains 
the information for styling the navigation bar.

Just as a note, the stylesheet coming form bootstrap seems to interfere with the nav_style.css stylesheet. I don't really understand how
or why its happening or for to address the issue.

This is the first time I've ever created a website or used HTML, CSS, and SCSS. I've learned quite a bit and hope to become more comfortable
with being able to design a page how I want it. Also, I like that git was introduced early on. Thanks for making these classes/lectures available.
